#Given a sorted array that may have duplicate values, use binary search to find the first and last indexes of a given value.

#For example, if you have the array [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6] and the given value is 3, the answer will be [4, 6] (because the value 3 occurs first at index 4 and last at index 6 in the array).

#The expected complexity of the problem is  O(log(n)).
